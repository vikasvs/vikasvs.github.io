                    <h2>detroit area origins</h2>
                    <p>I grew up in troy, michigan a suburb of detroit, a world vastly different from the bay. one thing i’ve noticed is a shared sense of home among people from the area. there is a passion to revitalize the city and bring it back to prominence. the industry detroit was built on has changed since the city was at its peak, and is in the midst of an urban renaissance that is truly amazing.</p>

                    <h2>student of urban development</h2>
                    <p>growing up in a city that crumbled and worked hard to rebuild itself made me admire urban development. At berkeley I wrote an extensive research paper on urban development and smart cities. As a head chair at berkeley model united nations i chaired a committee on urban development and energy utilization based on this paper. while urban development has its difficulties i believe it importance in solving many of todays problems can’t be understated.</p>

                    <h2>user centered creator</h2>
                    <p>to me a focal point of design is the user. since studying cs i’ve developed a keen interest in design and its impact on the user traffic of websites and apps. while design is frequently trivialized by many computer scientists, the core of design revolves around understanding people and their problems, which is a key component in any application.</p>

                    <h2>passion for efficiency</h2>
                    <p>I’m always searching for ways to become more efficient and maximize what I do with my time. in june i created a program to automize what I wear in the morning according to weather to help simplify my morning decisions. Finding ways to improve efficiency is a goal of mine, and i continue to look for new ways to make life better.</p>

                    <p>tech products are really cool and seem to make seem to make life more seamless. however i’m much more interested in tech for systems such as healthcare, education, finance, or government. i believe tech used to further the effectiveness of these systems is where the greatest added benefit to society lies, and something i like to focus on.</p>

                    <h2>avid sportsperson</h2>
                    <p>watching and playings sports has been a large part of my life. coming to college made falling out of touch with old friends easy, but anytime we are back home a pickup game brings us together. in the summer i worked to create a summer basketball league that grew to a great community brought together fun people. sports’ ability to provide enjoyment and renew friendships is something really cooland constantly exploited.</p>
