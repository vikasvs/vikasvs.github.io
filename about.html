			        	<h2>detroit area kid</h2>
			        	<p>i grew up in troy, michigan, a suburb of detroit and a starck contrast from the valley. one thing particularly interesting i notice from people common to are is the urge to revive the city we grew up hearing storeis about. detroit was built on an industry that will fluctuate in and out of relevance in 50 years, but has made leaps and bounds from its lows. while the city is still in the midst of a rebuild effetively rebuilding a great city like detroit is something i often think about.</p>

	                    <p> starting from early years in highscool I began teaching math and reading at kumon, and tried not to make kids too miserable along the way. in my senior year i transitioned to teaching act/sat but found it a bit repetive and similar to hammering information and strategies into peoples mind. starting at berkeley i hadn't touched cs in my life, and really relied on the teaching support system. i'm now happy to say i'm a part of that system and help in teaching berkeley's data structures and algorithms course(CS61b). teaching to me is one the most sacred ways to give back to society and im thankful ive had the opportunity to do so in (what i believe to be) a high impact setting.

			            <h2>dancer, athlete, fitness buff</h2>
			                    <p> sports culture is really ingrained in michigan. i personally think it stems from college athletic powerhouses(michigan & michigan state) shaping athletic culture. thus i grew up playing numerous sports from football to table-tennis and every ball size in between. growing up playing sports also meant watching what my favorite teams(go lions). my first year in berkeley i decided to try something different and joined a competitive bollywood dance team zahanat, (check out our performance at UCLA!). Joining zahanat has definetly been one of the highlights of my college experience. I met the coolest people i know, rediscovered some of my cultural identity, and got to travel across california and compete! my second year i 	felt a bit detached from sports culture, and didnt want to lose touch with such a large part of my life, so i joined an intramural soccer team and think it's been a great change of pace to the day-to-day grind. if i'm not holed up in some library or in the city catch me in the gym or playing any sport i can grab enough people to play with!</p>

			         	<h2>tech for systems</h2>
			         	<p> some of the coolest companies and most dominant companies have been those created for tech, such as facebook, slack, salesforce, etc. spending a summer at a networking company(juniper networks) that runs some of the worlds largest companies has been really interesting and really helped shape my perspective on what type of organizations I want to work for. while tech built for tech has its place and is incredibly important i find a lot more value added and potential impact in tech for systems such as finance, healthcare, government and education, and look forward to working with companies that leverage tech and systems. </p>

			         	<h2>student of financial & urban technology</h2>
			         	<p> growing up watching the city of detroit crumble and slowly pick itself back up really showed me the impact of urban innovation, and coming to the bay area and seeing the impact of technology on urban development has cultivated a keen interest in smart city and urban technology. ive often felt like the financial industry is unbelievably intricate and powers society as we know it. technologys impact on finance cannot be understanded, and i find that intersection to be extremly interesting and high-impact 

	            		as a member of berkeley model united nations, i've written extensive research papers on smart city development, energy efficiency, financial markets, and potential tech bubbles. this research coupled with great debate has given me a lot of interesting ideas regarding fintech and urbantech and look forward to working in the area.</p>
